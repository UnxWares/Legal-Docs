- **Bank transfer** (for certain business offers by quote)

Credit card payment processing is secured and outsourced to **Stripe**, a PCI-DSS certified payment provider.

**UnxWares does not collect or store Customer banking payment data.**

### 6.2. Billing and payment deadline

Invoices are automatically generated by Stripe at the **beginning of each ongoing Billing period**.

**Payment of the invoice is due within 15 calendar days from the invoice issue date.**

The Customer is solely responsible for ensuring payment is made within the allotted time.

**It is strongly recommended that the Customer configure automatic payment to avoid any oversight and service suspension.**

### 6.3. Automatic payment

For Services with automatic renewal, the Customer expressly authorizes UnxWares (via Stripe) to automatically charge the amount of invoices on the registered payment method.

The Customer may modify or remove their payment method at any time in their Customer area, subject to registering a new valid one to ensure Service continuity.

### 6.4. Automatic renewal

Unless cancelled by the Customer under the conditions provided in article 8, Services are automatically renewed for a Billing period identical to the one initially subscribed.

**The Customer is notified by email:**

- Before each renewal (generally 7 days before)
- When each invoice is issued

Automatic payment occurs at the beginning of the new Billing period.

### 6.5. Started billing period non-refundable

**IMPORTANT: Any started Billing period is fully payable, without possibility of pro-rata refund, including in case of:**

- Early cancellation by the Customer
- Non-actual use of Services
- Suspension for non-payment or breach of Terms of Use/T&C
- Termination by UnxWares for Customer breach

This provision applies regardless of the Billing period (weekly, monthly, annual).

**Example:** A Customer subscribing to a monthly plan on February 1 and cancelling their contract on February 10 remains liable for full payment for February, without refund for the 18 unused days.

### 6.6. Minimum commitment for weekly billing

For any Service subscribed with **weekly billing**, the Customer commits to a minimum duration of **one (1) month**, i.e., **4 consecutive weekly billing periods**.

In case of cancellation before the end of this minimum month, the remaining periods remain due and will be invoiced, without possibility of refund.

**Example:** A Customer subscribing on March 1 to a weekly plan commits until March 29 minimum (4 weeks). If they cancel on March 15, they remain liable for invoices until March 29 inclusive.

### 6.7. Late payment and suspension

**In case of non-payment of an invoice within 15 days:**

**1. Immediate and automatic suspension (15th day)**

Services are automatically suspended **without prior notice or formal demand** on the 15th calendar day following the issue of the unpaid invoice.

Suspension entails:

- Immediate interruption of Service access
- Inaccessibility of hosted Content (without immediate deletion)
- Continued billing (started period fully payable)

**2. Late payment penalties**

Late payment penalties equal to **three times the legal interest rate in force** (currently set by UK law) are automatically applied on amounts due, from the invoice due date.

These penalties run until full payment of all amounts due.

**3. Flat-rate compensation for collection costs**

A flat-rate compensation of **40 euros** for collection costs is automatically due, in accordance with UK commercial law.

This compensation is due independently of late payment penalties.

**4. Additional collection costs**

In case of collection costs actually incurred exceeding the flat-rate compensation of 40 euros, additional compensation may be required by UnxWares upon justification (lawyer fees, bailiff costs, etc.).

**5. Collection procedure**

In the absence of regularization after suspension, UnxWares reserves the right to initiate:

- An **amicable collection procedure** (reminders, formal notice)
- Then, if necessary, a **legal collection procedure** to obtain payment of amounts due, increased by penalties, compensation and costs incurred

**6. Immediate payment of all debts**

In case of late payment or breach of payment obligations, UnxWares may require **immediate payment of all amounts due, even if not yet due**, on all Services subscribed by the Customer.

**The Customer is solely responsible for monitoring their invoices and paying them on time. Non-receipt of reminder emails or notifications does not constitute a valid excuse in case of late payment.**

### 6.8. Reactivation after suspension for non-payment

After complete regularization of payment of the unpaid invoice and all associated penalties and compensation, the Customer may request reactivation of their Services.

**Reactivation conditions:**

- Full payment of all amounts due (unpaid invoice + penalties + compensation)
- Express reactivation request via Customer area or support
- Acceptance of reactivation by UnxWares (not automatic)

**Reactivation time**: Reactivation may require a technical delay of **24 to 48 business hours** after regularization.

**Additional guarantees:** UnxWares reserves the right to require, in case of repeated non-payment:

- Advance payment of several Billing periods
- A deposit or security
- Switch to mandatory automatic payment mode

### 6.9. Immediate billing in case of trial period abuse

UnxWares reserves the right to proceed with **immediate billing, without applying the free trial period**, in the following cases:

**Detected abuse situations:**

- Creation of multiple accounts to benefit from multiple trial periods
- Cancellation of a Service followed by new subscription to the same Service with identical or substantially similar Content
- Repetitive usage pattern manifestly aimed at circumventing normal billing conditions
- Use of false identities or contact details to multiply free trials

**Detection means:**

UnxWares implements automated and manual detection procedures, including:

- Analysis of email addresses, IP addresses, browser fingerprints
- Comparison of hosted Content (hash, metadata, patterns)
- Behavioral and temporal analysis of subscriptions/cancellations

**Consequences:**

- Immediate billing from the first day of subscription
- Refusal to apply trial period
- Possible Account suspension or closure
- Refusal of any new subscription

The Customer will be informed by email of the reasons for immediate billing and will have a right to contest if the detection proves erroneous.

### 6.10. Invoice dispute

Any invoice dispute must be addressed in writing (email) to UnxWares accounting department at **billing@unxwares.com** within **8 days** from the invoice issue date.

After this period, the invoice is deemed accepted.

Invoice dispute does not exempt the Customer from their obligation to pay on time. Disputed amounts remain payable until resolution of the dispute, unless otherwise agreed in writing by UnxWares.

<a id="7"></a>
## 7. Trial period and right of withdrawal

### 7.1. Free trial period

For certain Services and subject to eligibility, UnxWares offers a **free trial period** allowing the Customer to evaluate Services before definitive financial commitment.

**Trial period durations according to billing type:**

- **Weekly billing**: 2 free days
- **Monthly billing**: 7 free days
- **Annual billing**: 21 free days

**General trial period conditions:**

- **Eligibility**: available only for new Customers or for Services not previously subscribed by the Customer
- **Limitation**: only one trial period per Service and per Customer (identified by email, banking details, IP address, etc.)
- **Cancellation**: Customer may cancel at any time during trial period without charge and without commitment

### 7.2. Trial period operation

**Trial period start:** The trial period begins on the Service activation date following Order validation.

**During trial period:**

### 7.3. Trial period extension

Upon motivated request from the Customer to UnxWares support **before end of initial trial period**, it may be extended on a case-by-case basis, at UnxWares' discretion.

Extension requests will be considered particularly in the following cases:

- Need for more in-depth technical evaluation
- Complex migration tests
- Evaluation in context of large-scale project

No automatic extension is granted.

### 7.4. Right of withdrawal (consumer customers)

**For individual customers (consumers under UK Consumer Rights Act):**

In accordance with UK consumer protection law, consumers have a **14-day period** to exercise their right of withdrawal without justification or penalties.

**However**, in accordance with digital content exceptions, the right of withdrawal **does not apply** to contracts for supply of digital content not supplied on a tangible medium where performance has begun **after express prior consent of the consumer** and **express waiver of their right of withdrawal**.

**In practice:**

- When subscribing, the consumer Customer expressly consents to immediate provision of Services
- In return, UnxWares offers a free trial period (generally more advantageous than the 14 legal days)
- This trial period constitutes an **equivalent and often more favorable mechanism** than the legal right of withdrawal

**For business customers:**
The right of withdrawal does not apply in accordance with B2B regulations.

### 7.5. Abusive use of trial period

**It is strictly prohibited to:**

- Create multiple accounts (with different email addresses, false identities, etc.) to benefit from multiple trial periods
- Cancel a Service then re-register it with identical or substantially similar Content in order to benefit again from a trial period
- Use trial period for purposes other than legitimate and good faith evaluation of the Service
- Use trial Services for production uses or commercial purposes abusively

**In case of abusive use detection, UnxWares reserves the right to:**

- Refuse application of trial period for new subscriptions
- Bill Service immediately from first day (see article 6.9)
- Suspend or terminate Customer Account without notice
- Definitively refuse any new subscription by Customer
- Claim retroactive payment of abusively obtained trial periods

## 14. General provisions

### 14.1. Entire agreement

These T&C, supplemented by Terms of Use and associated contractual documents (Order confirmation, specific contracts, quotes, SLA, DPA), constitute **entire agreement** between UnxWares and Customer concerning commercial and contractual aspects of Service provision.

These documents replace all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations or commitments, written or oral, relating to same subject.

**Order of priority in case of contradiction:**

2. Individual Order confirmation
3. These T&C

5. Annexes (SLA, DPA, technical documentation)

### 14.2. Severability (savings clause)

If one or more provisions of these T&C are declared null, illegal or unenforceable pursuant to law, regulation or following court decision that has become final, other provisions will retain their full binding force and legal scope.

Parties will endeavor in good faith to replace invalidated clause(s) by valid and applicable clause(s) having economic and legal effect as close as possible to initial clause.

### 14.3. Waiver (non-waiver)

The fact that UnxWares does not rely, temporarily or permanently, on Customer breach of any obligations of these T&C cannot be interpreted as waiver to invoke said breach or any other subsequent breach.

No tolerance granted by UnxWares can be opposed to it, nor deprive UnxWares of right to demand at any time strict and complete performance of contractual obligations.

### 14.4. Assignment

**Prohibition of assignment by Customer:**

- Internal legal or structural reorganization
- Merger, acquisition or business transfer
- Change of control (equity investment, buyout)

Customer will be informed of any assignment by email with minimum **30 calendar days** notice. Customer will have right to cancel without charge if assignment substantially modifies contract performance conditions to their detriment.
