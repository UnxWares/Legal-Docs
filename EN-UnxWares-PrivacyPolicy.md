#### Important remarks

**Access to network frames and communications:**
In the normal operation of network and email infrastructures, certain providers (Netaris, Hetzner, Infomaniak) may technically have access to network frames, communication metadata or emails. This access is strictly limited to technical operation and maintenance needs, and these providers are contractually bound to confidentiality.

**Backups:**
Backups made by Infomaniak may contain all hosted data, including customer personal data and hosted content. These backups are encrypted and secured.

**Subcontracting chain:**
Some of these providers may themselves use subcontractors (for example, Pennylane used by Keobiz). UnxWares ensures that these second-tier subcontractors also comply with GDPR requirements.

### 5.3. Contractual guarantees

All UnxWares subcontractors:

- Are carefully selected based on their data protection guarantees

<a id="6"></a>
## 6. Data transfers outside the European Union

### 6.1. Limitation principle

UnxWares strives to limit as much as possible the transfer of personal data outside the European Union and the European Economic Area (EEA).

### 6.2. Necessary transfers

Some subcontractors may be located outside the EU/EEA:

- **Stripe** (United States) for payment processing
- **Infomaniak** (Switzerland) for domain names, DNS, backups and storage

**Note on Switzerland:**
Switzerland benefits from an adequacy decision from the European Commission dated July 26, 2000 (amended in 2023) recognizing a level of personal data protection essentially equivalent to that of the EU. Transfers to Switzerland are therefore facilitated, provided that the Swiss recipient does not subsequently transfer the data to a third country without appropriate safeguards.

### 6.3. Protection guarantees

When a transfer outside the EU/EEA is necessary, UnxWares ensures that appropriate safeguards are in place in accordance with GDPR:

**Mechanisms used:**

- **Adequacy decision** from the European Commission (if the country has an adequate level of protection)
- **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC)** approved by the European Commission
- **Binding Corporate Rules (BCR)** for international groups
- **Certifications** (Privacy Shield for the United States before its invalidation, replaced by the Data Privacy Framework if applicable)

**Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA):**
In accordance with the recommendations of the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), UnxWares assesses the risks associated with each transfer and implements additional protective measures if necessary.

### 6.4. User information
